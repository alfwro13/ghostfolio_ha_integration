# Ghostfolio Home Assistant Integration

A Home Assistant Custom Component (HACS integration) for monitoring your [Ghostfolio](https://github.com/ghostfolio/ghostfolio) portfolio performance.

## Features

This integration automatically detects your portfolio's base currency and offers granular tracking options:
- **Global Totals:** Track overall portfolio value and performance.
- **Account Breakdowns:** Individual sensors for each investment account.
- **Asset Tracking:** Dedicated sensors for every holding and watchlist item.
- **Price Alerts:** Configurable High/Low limit numbers for every asset to trigger automations.

### 1. Global Portfolio Sensors
- **Portfolio Value**: The current total market value of your portfolio.
- **Portfolio Cost**: The total amount of money you have invested.
- **Portfolio Gain**: The absolute net performance (Value - Cost).
- **Portfolio Gain FX**: The absolute net performance including currency effects.
- **Simple Gain %**: The simple percentage return, calculated as `(Value - Cost) / Cost`.
- **Time-Weighted Return %**: The Time-Weighted Rate of Return (TWR) of your portfolio (measures strategy performance, ignoring deposits/withdrawals).
- **Time-Weighted Return FX %**: The TWR percentage including currency effects.

### 2. Per-Account Sensors
Sensors are created for each of your Ghostfolio accounts (excluding hidden ones):
- **[Account Name] Value**: Current market value of the specific account.
- **[Account Name] Cost**: Total investment in the specific account.
- **[Account Name] Gain**: Absolute gain/loss for the specific account.
- **[Account Name] Simple Gain %**: Simple percentage gain/loss for the specific account.
- **[Account Name] Time-Weighted Return %**: Time-Weighted Return percentage for the specific account.

### 3. Per-Holding Sensors (Assets)
Track every individual asset in your portfolio with a dedicated sensor:
- **Sensor State**: Total market value of the holding in your base currency.
- **Friendly Name**: The ticker symbol (e.g., "AAPL", "VWRL.AS").
- **Attributes**: `market_price`, `average_buy_price`, `number_of_shares`, `gain_value`, `gain_pct`, `trend_vs_buy`.

### 4. Watchlist Sensors
Track items from your Ghostfolio Watchlist even if you don't own them yet.
- **Sensor State**: Current market price.
- **Friendly Name**: The ticker symbol (e.g., "TSLA").
- **Attributes**: `market_change_24h`, `market_change_pct_24h`, `trend_50d`, `trend_200d`.
*(Requires "Show Watchlist Items" to be enabled in configuration)*

### 5. Price Limit Configuration (Inputs)
For every Holding and Watchlist item, the integration creates two **Number** entities that allow you to set price targets directly from Home Assistant. You can use these in automations to send notifications when a price crosses your limit.

- **[Ticker] - Low Limit**
- **[Ticker] - High Limit**

**Entity Organization:**
These entities are grouped into **Devices** based on their Account (e.g., "ISA", "Watchlist").
- **Friendly Name**: `AAPL - High Limit`
- **Entity ID**: `number.isa_aapl_high_limit`
